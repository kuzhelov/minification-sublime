# minification-sublime

### Notes
This package is intended to be used with ***Sublime-Text 3*** only (due to the fact of subprocess module's import presence).

### Installation
In order to be installed the content should be copied to Sublime's package directory - for example, for Mac OS users it should be something like the following one:  
  
***/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/User/***
